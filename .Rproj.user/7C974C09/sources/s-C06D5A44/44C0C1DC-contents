Great negotiation is great collaboration

several people faced with different aspects of the same problem

the adversary is the situation

person across the table is a counterpart

work with them, solve the problem together

Achieve your goals through collaboration and tactical empathy that creates trust based influence

### Tactical Empathy

- Completely aware of the other side's perspective
- Not compassion, not sympathy, not agreement

Get at what's drinving someone

- You can change their outlook and their decision making
- Understand what their rules are
- Understand and respect what they are, don't necessarily follow them

Example: Journalist is kidnapped

- What is the commodity at stake
- What are they really negotiating for
- Trying to show themselves as a legitamite authority
- What were their rules that they violated?
        - They had complete control of her and they had her hair uncovered
        - They pushed this info through third party reporters, that they broke their own rules and disrespected her
- Then they put her father on the air
- They already said you'll go on the air and say "she's innocent", etc.
- These are trigger words, as soon as you say them you will feed into their justification for killing her

What he said:

- My daughter is not your enemy. She was reporting in Iraq, and if released, will go back to reporting on what is happening. Things that are indisputably true. We know from their culture that they believe that honor flows from the father.
- They saw her father in the media and said "your father is an honorable man"
- After this they didn't know what to do with her. 8 months later she showed up, freed.

*** An example of emotional intelligence.

### Mirroring

- A common misconception is that you have to make your case. You have to come prepared with the reasons why the other side should make the deal. Your "value proposition".

- Find out what's possible
- Engage the other side in what their thoughts are
- They will feel involved in a process, consequently they want the deal to happen
- Tease out the information you might not have had otherwise
- Letting the other side have your way
- Mirroring gets the other side talking, creates the opportunity for them to present you with your deal, only they thought it was their idea

#### Gathering Information

- Repeat back to them what they said, but say you still don't get it. They're going to respond with more words and go into more detail.
- The other side loves it when you're paying attention
- They love it when you gently know what they've said is inadequate but they haven't been accused of being inadequate

#### Building Rapport

- People love to be mirrored and encouraged to go on
- If you mirror, you will be interesting to other people because you're interested in them
- they'll love talking to you
- If you're genuinely curious about the other person, you're interested. You're looking forward to what they have to say. You want to learn from them. You're positive about it. You're not judgemental
- Finish with a tone of voice of genuine curiosity

#### Confrontational People

- Someone is confrontational, keep questioning their problem.
- The price is too high? You have a lot of other stuff to worry about? etc.
- You'll get information out of them, they'll provide more context, and it'll feel like you're working with them. It won't feel like you're fighting
- It takes 2 to fight
- Turn the wrestling match into a dance
        - This will change the conflict into a collaboration

#### The recipe

- The last 1-3 words of what someone just said
- Critical issue is to pause, dynamic silence.
- Some are afraid that the silence will be taken as anger
- First display that you're interested, then it will give time for the other side to think
- You really want to hear and you'll shut up until they do

#### Keep Mirroring

- Feel awkward? Counterintuitive? Don't believe it?
- You're creating a new skill
- awkwardness is an indicator of learningn
- It's gonna feel awkward, it'll feel like people will call you out for mirroring them
- Keep practicing and you'll get past the awkwardness, like every other skill

### Labeling

- Putting a label on a negative emotion reduces the negative emotion
- The most useful skill, the most mcgyver skill, the most innocuous, the most different applications
- Their simplicity gives them elegance

#### Label It!

Steps

1. You being aware of the emotion or dynamic from the other side
        - You've got a great gut instict. 
        - First step is becoming aware of what you're gut instinct is picking up
        - Label it. "It seems like, sounds like, looks like, feels like... etc"

You seem upset.
Am I upset? - This contemplation deactivates the negative.
        
- Build the relationship and help you gather relationship at the same time
- Your influence with the other side is going to increase
- Trust based influence
- lowest maintenance most durable type of influence there is

#### How not to label

- "What I'm hearing is..."
        - Dropped the word "I" in inappropriately
        - I'm more interested in my perspective than yours
- Resist the urge to explain a label or add some follow up
        - Let a good label sink in
        - It has to trigger the contemplation
        - Fully deactivate the negatives

#### Label more than once

- Cumulative
- Remember: the deactivation can be of different strengths
- A lack of response to a negative label is a good sign that you're on the right track
- Sounds like I haven't gone far enough, sounds like there's more here than meets the eye, sounds like there's some feelings you have about this that I haven't quite touched yet

#### Reinforce Positive Emotions

- Labeling a positive reinforces it
- A phone call with customer service 
        - they're short tempered, having a bad day, they know you're mad in advance
        - Their impatience, empathy, their perspective is that  you are lucky to be talking with them and they are being generous with their time.
        - Positive: I appreciate you being generous with your time. It feels like you're being really generous with me right now.
- Use a positive label to build up and reinforce qualities that might be there but burried

#### Mirroring and Labeling in Tandem

- Mirrors are a great way to dial in on labels
- After labeling, they might have given you a lot of information that you might want to expand on
        - Whatever their response is to the label, you can mirror a few words after that response and get more information out

Ex. Sounds like this deal is making you upset.
- Not making me upset, what it really is - we have some implementation problems we had problems in the past
- Problems in the past?
- the previous vendor caused problems. We're still early in the relationship
- Early in the relationship?

These questions help you to ease out any contradictions you might be having regarding them as well
